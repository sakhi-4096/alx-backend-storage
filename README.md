## Description
Backend storage refers to the infrastructure and systems that store and manage data on the server side of a software application. It involves storing, retrieving, and organizing data to support the functionality of the application. This data can include user information, application settings, files, and other relevant information needed for the application to operate. Backend storage solutions vary and may include databases, file systems, cloud storage, or a combination of these technologies.
