# NoSQL
NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are a category of databases that provide a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in a way other than the traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS).

## Description
Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and can be horizontally scaled across multiple servers.

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that falls into the category of document-oriented databases. Here are some key characteristics and concepts associated with MongoDB

## Features
* **Document-Oriented:** MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents known as BSON (Binary JSON). Each document can have a different structure, allowing for a dynamic schema.
* **Collections:** Documents are organized into collections, which are equivalent to tables in relational databases. Collections can contain documents with different structures, providing flexibility in data representation.
* **No Schema Migration:** MongoDB allows for dynamic schema, meaning you can insert documents into a collection without predefining the structure. This flexibility is useful when dealing with evolving data requirements.
* **Query Language:** MongoDB uses a rich query language, supporting queries based on the structure of documents as well as field values. It supports a wide range of query operations, including complex queries, indexing, and aggregation.
* **Scalability:** MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by sharding data across multiple servers. This allows it to handle large amounts of data and high write and read loads.
* **Indexes:** MongoDB supports the creation of indexes on fields within documents, improving query performance.
* **Replication:** MongoDB provides replication for high availability. Data can be replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring that if one node goes down, another can take its place.
